### Who
Previous B2C sales developer turned software developer. I love the power of automation that software scripting flexes into our daily lives. My passion revolves around connecting technologies in creative ways to solve social, economic, and environmental issues. 

### What
I enjoy seeking the "missing-link" in problems. I believe that there is so much more potential for growth and experiment in web and mobile applications, and I am determined to find those links creatively and programmatically.
